# Hoppers-Mod

Hoppers are items that let you automatically move items to and from input and output slots in other menus! You can craft Hoppers in the Workbench. Once put down you'll be able to set the two filter items.

The "gather" filter decides what items will be gathered from the output slots of nearby machines.
The "distribute" filter decides what items will be distributed to the input slots of nearby machines.

Some hopper ideas:
- Have a bee in both gather + distribute near a beehive for an automatic quick queen resupply!
- Move filled frames automatically into a nearby Uncapper
- Gather chopped planks/sticks from a nearby Sawbench
